Final Project -  Max Evans


There are two goals to this website: 

1. Display what I have learned in my HTML/CSS/Javascript course in grad school 
2. Display past gaming projects I have worked on 

As I continue to update this site, I hope to make it more accessible to users with disabilities. 

All color combinations are made from a custom color palette I designed that is both color-blind friendly, and maintains a W3C Contrast score of >4.5 for white and black foregrounds (such as text colors against a background.)

On the settings page, the user has the option to convert the entire website to OpenDyslexic
