                Often times, disabled users are left out of the discussion in the design of every day products, such as video games and websites. Max hopes that, over the course of his degree, he can learn how to make his projects more accessible for all people.  Below is an example of a Pokemon-Like game Max experimented on that uses just one button for all of it's controls.  This is a design pattern that can be helpful for people with mobility disabilities. To move across the map, players press the the space bar to rotate 90 degrees, and to move forward in that direction, players hold the space bar. When on a menu screen, pressing the space bar changes the option hovered in the screen, and holding the space bar selects the option highlighted.
