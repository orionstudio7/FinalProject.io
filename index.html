            <p>&emsp;Max Evans got his Bachelor's from the Massichusetts Institute of Technology in Mechanical Engineering. He also got a minor in Creative Writing during his time at MIT. Currently, 
            he is getting his Master's degree from Boston University's Metropolitan College in Software Development. Max currently works as a Game Engineering Intern at Demiurge Studios.<br /></p>
            <p>&emsp;Max is passionate about a lot of things, including lizards and accessible design in video games.  He has two lizards: Horatio the Leopard Gecko, and Mochi the Blue Tongue Skink. As
            a disabled trans guy, he cares a lot about making sure the games he makes are inviting and welcoming to all players. He has experimented with video games that that use only one button as their controls, 
            and is starting to experiment with audio-based games. </p>
